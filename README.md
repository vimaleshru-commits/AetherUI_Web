AetherUI Web is a browser-based interactive HUD that turns any webcam into a real-time, Iron Man-style interface. Built with JavaScript, MediaPipe FaceMesh, and face-api.js, it runs entirely in the browser with no installation or platform restrictions, making it instantly accessible on any modern device.
